            <h1>About this program</h1>
            <p>
                Data Science has been ranked as one of the hottest professions and the demand for data practitioners is booming. 
                This program is intended for anyone interested in developing skills and experience to pursue a 
                <span className="font-weight-bold"> career in Data Science </span> or Machine Learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This program consists of 5 courses providing you with latest job-ready skills and techniques covering a wide array 
                of data science topics including: open source tools and libraries, methodologies, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, 
                data analysis, and machine learning. You will practice <span className="font-weight-bold">hands-on </span>in the using real 
                data science tools and real-world data sets.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a myth that to become a data scientist you need a Ph.D. This Professional Certificate is suitable for anyone who has 
                some computer skills and a passion for self-learning. No prior computer science or programming knowledge is necessary. 
                We start small, re-enforce applied learning, and build up to more complex topics.

The videos are well organized and provide fair amount of information to complete the assignments and challenges. The only thing I felt tasking was the fee associated with this degree. I think it can be lowered a lot given the fact that students are mostly on their own with time management and assignment completion. Overall I would say, I am enjoying this learning journey and hope to complete it in the coming weeks.</p>

Have come across lot of trainings and courses throughout my 10 years of experience. This course distinguishes from others by having clarity on the topics that were explained. As we know, a picture portrays 1000 words, creating a video series to explain everything plays a vital role in making the concepts clear to all learners. Thank you for all the creators of this course.</p>
