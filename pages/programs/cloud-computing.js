            <p>
                The Cloud Computing takes you on a tour through cloud computing systems. 
                We start in in the middle layer with Cloud Computing Concepts covering core distributed 
                systems concepts used inside clouds, move to the upper layer of Cloud Applications and 
                finally to the lower layer of Cloud Networking. We conclude with a project that allows you 
                to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-weight-bold">DevOps Engineers</span> optimize, automate, and monitor 
                development pipelines. They focus on ensuring that products and services are delivered smoothly 
                and at scale by building and optimizing cloud architecture and configuration. This role is a great
                 fit for a developer looking to shift your career towards a more operational role, or a 
                 system admin / operations manager who wants to upgrade their tech skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span className="font-weight-bold">Cloud Developers</span> design and develop secure cloud applications, 
                services, and products. This can include everything from back-end, front-end, web application, full-stack,
                and cloud application deployment. You will develop cloud-native applications or migrate legacy applications 
                to cloud.
